## 🚀 Final Thoughts

This project has been a rewarding exploration of web development fundamentals. From structuring content to styling with CSS, each step has deepened my understanding of how to build functional and visually appealing websites.
In a project like this one, it is always wise to always seek the understanding of the work first and implement the solution once one has gotten the grasp of things. It comes with great knowledge, especially this iteration where I learned a lot about SEO, which according to the “10 Most Important HTML Meta Tags for SEO” author(s) refers to the techniques and practices for the process of improving the visibility and ranking of a web page in the result of the search engine.
